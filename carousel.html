        <p class="title">A brilliant and generous concept</p>
            <p class="quote">"The Intimacy Project is a brilliant and generous concept, led from the heart to support both body and spirit. Each person's experience is individually tailored to their own needs. Ana and David bring both a serious attention and a great lightness of touch to this work, to provide you with the most bespoke of life-enhancing programmes.”<b> Claire</b></p>

            <p class="quote">"Taking part in the Intimacy Project has been a very beautiful experience - they adapted to my work schedule and woke up early to give me individual daily classes at 6am. It is a great pleasure to have them as your personal intimate 'Yoga Support System'"<b> Cornelia</b></p>

            <p class="title">Connect with your inner self</p>
            <p class="quote">"I had a great time learning more about yoga with you, Ana. You explained it so well, calming and encouraging a nervous soul like me. You gave some new ideas too - the stick figures you helped me make for my program were excellent. Your good moods and humour made an intensive teacher training really enjoyable. I will miss learning yoga from you. Your new students are lucky!”<b> Ida</b></p>
