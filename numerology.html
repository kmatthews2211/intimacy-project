                    <h3>What is Numerology?</h3>
                    <p>Numerology is based on 5,000 years of experience and research. Although it's important to accept that Numerology is not an exact science, it is an empowering way to identify and label some of the more visible aspects of ourselves, as we are incredibly complex human beings. </p>
                    <p>Through discussion, Numerology is a valuable technique to help bring understanding and acceptance to yourself in the present moment. A Numerology reading uses the numbers to shine light on parts of yourself that may be bringing internal conflicts, or be creating confusion within yourself when interacting with the world. Through understanding your personal numbers, you can begin to create a sense of acceptance and kindness towards yourself, cultivating the courage to simply be you.</p>
                    <p>Receiving a Numerology reading can empower you to accept all parts of yourself as they, enabling you move fluidly as you change from day to day.</p>

                    <p>Together with numerologist Ana, you will discover your personal numbers that can reveal how you interact with your external and internal world. We will look at how they interact with each other, how you feel them, and most importantly, we show you how to work with them.</p>
                    <p>A Numerology reading will take about 1 hour, sometimes a bit longer depending on discussion. We will meet either in person, or online using WhatsApp, Zoom or Facebook messenger - whatever is easiest for you.</p><br>

                        <li>When receiving a Numerology reading from Ana, not all the characteristics of the numbers will be shared, as they may not be present at that time. Your reading will be of a transient nature, and applicable to you in the moment. The characteristics of each number show up at different times, therefore your reading is not set in stone. Each number within your personal chart holds such a vast array of characteristics that will show up in a multitude of different ways. Therefore, gaining an understanding of each number in its entirety can help in the future when different characteristics show up.</li>
                        <li>As a gift, you will receive Ana's full explanation of the 9 single-digit numbers for future reference following your reading. </li>
                        <li>The numbers within your chart that we will discuss are as follows:</li>

                                <li>Soul number (your internal thought and reactions) </li>
                                <li>Personality number (what others see first, and how you physically interact with the world)</li>

                                <li>Missing number (indicates the characteristics of any void that you might be trying to fill, consciously or unconsciously)</li>

              <p class="quote">"I began the project with Ana in January 2020. At the time, I was experiencing PTSD which had greatly impacted all areas of my life. Probably the most significant was my ability to be with people, as where previously, I was an outgoing, what I believed to be connected person. Ana's teaching style was nurturing, gentle, and at times confronting all the elements I needed for growth.

In turn, my anxiety is rare and the manifestations of PTSD are in the past. I think the most valuable gift I received from Ana was not only in helping me but also my teenage daughter. Ana did private sessions with her at a time when she would not talk to anyone, especially me. As a mother, I felt responsible and unsure how to navigate helping her. Ana's sessions enabled my daughter to find her own boundaries, express them and we are now communicating again...”</p>
