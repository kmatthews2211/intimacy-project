                But let's face it, life happens. Busy work schedules, the needs of others. Relationships in all their beautiful (and sometimes unbeautiful) details. <br><br>
                It's so easy to talk, listen and agree. However, it's a whole other matter to actually implement and make a lasting change that moves us beyond the habitual patterns that constantly cause distress and disharmony in our lives.<br><br>
                The fact is, we are all here, living and breathing together, and we are born to embrace our lives, and express the beautiful uniqueness that is within each of us. <br><br>
                Habitual patterns (samskara), labels, fear, judgement and criticism: they are all just symptoms of learned behaviour that we have developed in our lives.<br><br>
                But it doesn't have to be that way. That's why we created The Intimacy Project</p>

                    <p>When you find yourself in a state of imbalance, it is coming back to simplicity which allows you to find balance once again. This is the essence of what Ana shares and the foundation of her Life. </p>
                    <p>Through her unique combination of Yoga Asana, Pranayama, QiGong and intuitive movement, Ana guides you through your own practice, creating space for you to breathe in your own body, and move in your own way to bring all the energies into balance.</p>
                    <p>Ana's true passion is to share Dharma in a way that each individual can integrate into their lives, giving them the practical tools to live a more truthful and joyful life.</p>
                    <p>Ana's yoga journey began in 2016 after a near death experience in New Zealand. This was the spark of change that lead her to experience her first yoga class. Since then, she has been traveling and experiencing different teachings in Australia, India and the UK, diving deep into Hatha, Ashtanga, Yin, Pranayama, meditation, Qi-Gong, nature, life and love.</p>
                    <p>Her down to earth, real-life application makes anything seem possible. Her nature is intuitive, creative, joyful and she will ensure you receive exactly what you need. The unachievable, is achievable. You just have to believe.</p>

                    <h4>About David</h4>
                    <p>In 2013 David quit his job and decided to walk from Europe to India, following the path of the heart. He is dedicated to the practical application of spiritual teachings in life.</p>
                    <p>As a foundation, he follows the principles of Raja Yoga, and believes each of us has the capacity to go beyond habitual patterns and ways of thinking to express the unique beauty that is inside, allowing us to live in peace, harmony and love, with ourselves, each other and the world we all share.</p> 
                    <p>After studying with many teachers from different traditions, his own daily practice is a combination of breath led intuitive movement, balanced with stillness. He takes great joy in supporting others towards authentic self expression.</p>
                    <p>By integrating a nourishing daily practice into our lives, we listen to the silent song of the heart, and open more fully to love. Nature takes care of everything else.</p>

I've practiced different styles before, but they really helped me to find my way, showed me sides of myself in a very gentle way, and made the programme fit to the demands of my life. You also might get to see the amazing places and beautiful sunrises where they practice! They supported me early in the morning and were a big help at a challenging time.

You gave some new ideas too - the stick figures you helped me make for my program were excellent. Your good moods and humour made an intensive teacher training really enjoyable. I will miss learning yoga from you. Your new students are lucky!”<br><b> Ida</b></p>

David brings great care and conviction to his practice. He is thoughtful, gentle and strong, combining wisdom from a range of philosophical approaches, and always centring that wisdom in the body's experience[...],working in ways that were both simple and profound to release ease and happiness.” <br><b> Claire</b></p>

I feel free to ask for what I want and they freely and lovingly give me what they feel I need. Everything feels like a delicious suggestion which makes me jump in, give it a try and find out what is going on: like the suggestion that one keeps a meditation journal. I normally hate journaling but this was so powerful and offered in such a way that I had to give it a try. <a href="./images/Intimacy Project Love Letter.pdf" target="_blank">Read more</a>” <br><b> Rene</b></p>

            <p class="quote">"I began the project with Ana in January 2020. At the time, I was experiencing PTSD which had greatly impacted all areas of my life. Probably the most significant was my ability to be with people, as where previously, I was an outgoing, what I believed to be connected person. Ana's teaching style was nurturing, gentle, and at times confronting all the elements I needed for growth. At the time of beginning the project, I struggled to sleep, suffered from anxiety attacks and became overwhelmed by what most would see as simple tasks...”</p>

In turn, my anxiety is rare and the manifestations of PTSD are in the past. I think the most valuable gift I received from Ana was not only in helping me but also my teenage daughter. Ana did private sessions with her at a time when she would not talk to anyone, especially me. As a mother, I felt responsible and unsure how to navigate helping her. Ana's sessions enabled my daughter to find her own boundaries, express them and we are now communicating again...”</p>
