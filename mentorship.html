                    <h3>The 1:1 Mentorship Programme</h3>
                    <p>The mentorship programme is about integration.</p>
                    <p>Having a daily practice that is right for you is the basis of everything. With the support of a yoga teacher and friend, we can navigate through life more skillfully.</p>
                    <p>When we integrate a daily practice into our lives, other people start to notice subtle changes and want to learn about it for themselves. And in turn, because we love it so much, we want to share it!</p>
                    <p>So to support that, we support you.</p>

                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>We have 1-2 online sessions a week where we work towards a goal that is important to you. This could be learning about teaching, the teaching principles, going deeper into the breath, exploring philosophies, asana, general life support, natural living advice, relationship queries... whatever arises.</p>
                    <p>Our mentorship opportunity allows you to feel supported towards your goals, sharing teachings, stories and experiences. Plus we get to hang out every week!</p>
                    <p>The mentorship lasts for as long as you need, and if you are working towards teaching yoga yourself, the support will continue until you are ready. The programme is fluid and works directly with you. It is a natural progression from participation in the 40 day Immersion and allows you to continue, fully supported, in your journey.</p>
                    <p>Cost: £200/month</p>

I've practiced different styles before, but they really helped me to find my way, showed me sides of myself in a very gentle way, and made the programme fit to the demands of my life. You also might get to see the amazing places and beautiful sunrises where they practice! They supported me early in the morning and were a big help at a challenging time.

I feel free to ask for what I want and they freely and lovingly give me what they feel I need. Everything feels like a delicious suggestion which makes me jump in, give it a try and find out what is going on: like the suggestion that one keeps a meditation journal.

Probably the most significant was my ability to be with people, as where previously, I was an outgoing, what I believed to be connected person. Ana's teaching style was nurturing, gentle, and at times confronting all the elements I needed for growth.

In turn, my anxiety is rare and the manifestations of PTSD are in the past. I think the most valuable gift I received from Ana was not only in helping me but also my teenage daughter. Ana did private sessions with her at a time when she would not talk to anyone, especially me. As a mother, I felt responsible and unsure how to navigate helping her.
