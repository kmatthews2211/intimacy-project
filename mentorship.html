                    <h3>The 1:1 Mentorship Programme</h3>
                    <p>The mentorship programme is about integration.</p>
                    <p>Having a daily practice that is right for you is the basis of everything. With the support of a yoga teacher and friend, we can navigate through life more skillfully.</p>
                    <p>When we integrate a daily practice into our lives, other people start to notice subtle changes and want to learn about it for themselves. And in turn, because we love it so much, we want to share it!</p>
                    <p>So to support that, we support you.</p>

                    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                    <p>We have 1-2 online sessions a week where we work towards a goal that is important to you. This could be learning about teaching, the teaching principles, going deeper into the breath, exploring philosophies, asana, general life support, natural living advice, relationship queries... whatever arises.</p>
                    <p>Our mentorship opportunity allows you to feel supported towards your goals, sharing teachings, stories and experiences. Plus we get to hang out every week!</p>
                    <p>The mentorship lasts for as long as you need, and if you are working towards teaching yoga yourself, the support will continue until you are ready. The programme is fluid and works directly with you. It is a natural progression from participation in the 40 day Immersion and allows you to continue, fully supported, in your journey.</p>
                    <p>Cost: Â£200/month</p>

            <p class="quote">"The Intimacy Project has been a true blessing for me! Ana & David are wonderful and generous teachers and have a vast and deep knowledge. I've practiced different styles before, but they really helped me to find my way, showed me sides of myself in a very gentle way, and made the programme fit to the demands of my life. You also might get to see the amazing places and beautiful sunrises where they practice! They supported me early in the morning and were a big help at a challenging time. I am deeply grateful and thankful for these two lovely beings and their programme. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing this gift.â<br><b> Nadja</b></p>

David brings great care and conviction to his practice. He is thoughtful, gentle and strong, combining wisdom from a range of philosophical approaches, and always centring that wisdom in the body's experience[...],working in ways that were both simple and profound to release ease and happiness.â <br><b> Claire</b></p>

I feel free to ask for what I want and they freely and lovingly give me what they feel I need. Everything feels like a delicious suggestion which makes me jump in, give it a try and find out what is going on: like the suggestion that one keeps a meditation journal.

Ana radiates joy and has a capacity for happiness that is rare and infectious. She also has a great ability to bring people together, uniting us in our different practices. Her work is spiritually inflected and focuses particularly on women and our lived experiences in the body. She lives as she preaches, working on release, acceptance and joy.â <br><b> Claire</b></p>

            <p class="quote">"I began the project with Ana in January 2020. At the time, I was experiencing PTSD which had greatly impacted all areas of my life. Probably the most significant was my ability to be with people, as where previously, I was an outgoing, what I believed to be connected person. Ana's teaching style was nurturing, gentle, and at times confronting all the elements I needed for growth. At the time of beginning the project, I struggled to sleep, suffered from anxiety attacks and became overwhelmed by what most would see as simple tasks...â</p>

            <p class="quote">"...Now two years on I can sleep just by practising breathing exercises and have an ability to ground myself when I am triggered. In turn, my anxiety is rare and the manifestations of PTSD are in the past. I think the most valuable gift I received from Ana was not only in helping me but also my teenage daughter. Ana did private sessions with her at a time when she would not talk to anyone, especially me. As a mother, I felt responsible and unsure how to navigate helping her. Ana's sessions enabled my daughter to find her own boundaries, express them and we are now communicating again...â</p>

Always a work in progress, but the tools I gained from the project I use everyday and Ana to me is a woman of great integrity, sensitivity and intuitive fun. Thank you sister for contributing to my family. You have a very sacred place in our hearts.
