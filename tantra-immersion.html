              <p class="quote">"The Intimacy Project has been a true blessing for me! Ana & David are wonderful and generous teachers and have a vast and deep knowledge. I've practiced different styles before, but they really helped me to find my way, showed me sides of myself in a very gentle way, and made the programme fit to the demands of my life. You also might get to see the amazing places and beautiful sunrises where they practice! They supported me early in the morning and were a big help at a challenging time. I am deeply grateful and thankful for these two lovely beings and their programme. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for sharing this gift.”<br><b> Nadja</b></p>

I feel free to ask for what I want and they freely and lovingly give me what they feel I need. Everything feels like a delicious suggestion which makes me jump in, give it a try and find out what is going on: like the suggestion that one keeps a meditation journal. I normally hate journaling but this was so powerful and offered in such a way that I had to give it a try. <a href="./images/Intimacy Project Love Letter.pdf" target="_blank">Read more</a>” <br><b> Rene</b></p>

Ana radiates joy and has a capacity for happiness that is rare and infectious. She also has a great ability to bring people together, uniting us in our different practices.

              <p class="quote">"I began the project with Ana in January 2020. At the time, I was experiencing PTSD which had greatly impacted all areas of my life. Probably the most significant was my ability to be with people, as where previously, I was an outgoing, what I believed to be connected person. Ana's teaching style was nurturing, gentle, and at times confronting all the elements I needed for growth.
