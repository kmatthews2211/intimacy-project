I've practiced different styles before, but they really helped me to find my way, showed me sides of myself in a very gentle way, and made the programme fit to the demands of my life. You also might get to see the amazing places and beautiful sunrises where they practice! They supported me early in the morning and were a big help at a challenging time.

I feel free to ask for what I want and they freely and lovingly give me what they feel I need. Everything feels like a delicious suggestion which makes me jump in, give it a try and find out what is going on: like the suggestion that one keeps a meditation journal.

Probably the most significant was my ability to be with people, as where previously, I was an outgoing, what I believed to be connected person. Ana's teaching style was nurturing, gentle, and at times confronting all the elements I needed for growth. At the time of beginning the project, I struggled to sleep, suffered from anxiety attacks and became overwhelmed by what most would see as simple tasks...”</p>

In turn, my anxiety is rare and the manifestations of PTSD are in the past. I think the most valuable gift I received from Ana was not only in helping me but also my teenage daughter. Ana did private sessions with her at a time when she would not talk to anyone, especially me. As a mother, I felt responsible and unsure how to navigate helping her. Ana's sessions enabled my daughter to find her own boundaries, express them and we are now communicating again...”</p>
