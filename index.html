                    <p class="quote">"I worked with Ana for most of the second year of Covid, incorporating gentle movement into the breathing practice. Her yoga nidra is exceptional. Ana radiates joy and has a capacity for happiness that is rare and infectious. She also has a great ability to bring people together, uniting us in our different practices.

                    <p class="quote">"I began the project with Ana in January 2020. At the time, I was experiencing PTSD which had greatly impacted all areas of my life. Probably the most significant was my ability to be with people, as where previously, I was an outgoing, what I believed to be connected person. Ana's teaching style was nurturing, gentle, and at times confronting all the elements I needed for growth. At the time of beginning the project, I struggled to sleep, suffered from anxiety attacks and became overwhelmed by what most would see as simple tasks...‚Äù</p>

                    <p class="quote">"...Now two years on I can sleep just by practising breathing exercises and have an ability to ground myself when I am triggered. In turn, my anxiety is rare and the manifestations of PTSD are in the past. I think the most valuable gift I received from Ana was not only in helping me but also my teenage daughter. Ana did private sessions with her at a time when she would not talk to anyone, especially me. As a mother, I felt responsible and unsure how to navigate helping her. Ana's sessions enabled my daughter to find her own boundaries, express them and we are now communicating again...‚Äù</p>

Always a work in progress, but the tools I gained from the project I use everyday and Ana to me is a woman of great integrity, sensitivity and intuitive fun.
