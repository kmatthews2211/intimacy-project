                    <p class="quote">"I began the project with Ana in January 2020. At the time, I was experiencing PTSD which had greatly impacted all areas of my life. Probably the most significant was my ability to be with people, as where previously, I was an outgoing, what I believed to be connected person.

In turn, my anxiety is rare and the manifestations of PTSD are in the past. I think the most valuable gift I received from Ana was not only in helping me but also my teenage daughter. Ana did private sessions with her at a time when she would not talk to anyone, especially me. As a mother, I felt responsible and unsure how to navigate helping her.
